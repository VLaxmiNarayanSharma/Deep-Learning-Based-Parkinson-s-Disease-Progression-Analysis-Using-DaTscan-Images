Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide, leading to progressive motor dysfunction and various non-motor symptoms. As the disease progresses, it significantly impacts the quality of life of patients, making early diagnosis and accurate tracking of its progression crucial for effective treatment.
Traditional methods for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson’s rely heavily on clinical observation and subjective assessments, which can often result in late diagnoses or inconsistent tracking of disease progression. DaTscan imaging, which provides detailed visualizations of dopamine transporter levels in the brain, has become a valuable tool for clinicians. However, manual interpretation of these scans can be time-consuming and prone to error.
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for the analysis of DaTscan images, aiming to predict the severity and progression of Parkinson’s disease. By combining data from DaTscan images and UCI’s Parkinson’s Telemonitoring Vocal Data Set, we aim to build robust models that improve diagnostic accuracy, enable early intervention, and support better disease management for patients with Parkinson’s disease.
